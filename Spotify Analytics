# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

#What are the top 25 most popular songs and and artists and whats the songs danceability?

select track_name, artist_name, popularity, danceability,
  case when danceability <= 0.510 then " just vibes"
  when danceability <= 0.750 then "pretty dancey"
  when danceability >= 0.751 then "dance dance"
  end as "how dancey"
from bit_db.spotifydata
order by popularity desc
limit 25;

#Who has the most popular song and whats the title?

select artist_name, track_name, max(popularity) as popularity
from spotifydata;

#What 5 songs have the least energy and how popular are they?

select artist_name, track_name, energy, popularity
from spotifydata
order by energy
limit 5;

#What are the most popular acoustic songs?

select artist_name, track_name, acousticness, popularity
from spotifydata
where acousticness >=0.55
order by popularity desc;

#What is the longest song released and how much energy did it have?

select artist_name, track_name, duration_ms, energy
from spotifydata
order by duration_ms desc
limit 1;

#Who has the most songs in the top 50 and how many songs do they have?

select artist_name, count(track_name) as "num of songs"
from spotifydata
group by artist_name
order by count(*) desc
limit 1;

-#What is the average song length?

select round(avg(duration_ms/60000),2) as "avg length"
from spotifydata;

#What is the tempo of the most energetic songs?

Select track_name, energy, tempo
from spotifydata
order by energy desc
